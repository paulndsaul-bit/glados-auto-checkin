## Highlights

- **Multiple platforms**: browsers, Surge, Quantumult X, and GitHub Actions
- **Multiple accounts**: ScriptCat checks different accounts logged in on different main-site domains; this project's first GitHub Actions version is intentionally single-account
- **No manual cookie entry** (local options): uses your browser session or captures credentials via your proxy app
- **Optional cloud run**: GitHub Actions accepts one or more account cookies via a Repository Secret
- **Smart fallback**: skips later local tasks after a successful day; within a single Actions run, successful/already-checked accounts are not checked in again
- **Reliable results**: distinguishes a new check-in from an already completed one and avoids false success reports
- **Limited retries**: retries network errors, HTTP 429, and 5xx responses once
- **Privacy-minded**: local credentials stay on device; Actions logs redact cookies and never echo secrets

## Quick Start

Choose one method for your environment. You do not need every option.

| Method | Account support | Key difference | Recommended use | MitM | Manual cookie | Install |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Browser (ScriptCat)** | Multiple accounts on different main-site domains | Reuses browser sessions without copying cookies | Multiple accounts; regular Chrome / Edge / Firefox use | No | No | [View setup](#chrome--edge--firefox) |
| **Surge module** | One account; the latest captured account replaces the previous one | Runs locally without a background browser | Regular Surge use with one account | Yes | No | [View setup](#surge) |
| **Quantumult X config** | One account; the latest captured account replaces the previous one | Fits an existing Rewrite and scheduled-task setup | Regular Quantumult X use with one account | Yes | No | [View setup](#quantumult-x) |
| **GitHub Actions** | One account; cookie injected through a Secret | Runs in the cloud without a browser or proxy app | No always-on local device | No | Yes (Secret) | [View setup](#github-actions) |

### Chrome / Edge / Firefox

The browser version is a background scheduled script for [ScriptCat](https://docs.scriptcat.org/). It does not require packet capture, manual cookie entry, or an open GLaDOS tab.

1. Install ScriptCat from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/scriptcat/ndcooeababalnlpkfedmmbbbgkljhpjf), [Microsoft Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/scriptcat/liilgpjgabokdklappibcjfablkpcekh), or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/scriptcat/).
2. Open the [GLaDOS Auto Check-in script page](https://scriptcat.org/en/script-show-page/7014) and select Install.
3. Sign in to any GLaDOS main site in the same browser, for example [glados.network](https://glados.network/). Also supported: `glados.rocks`, `glados.one`, `glados.space`, `glados.cloud`, `glados.vip`, and `glados-facility.com` (not the defunct `glados.live` or the promo redirect `glados.top`).
4. For multiple accounts, sign in to a different account on each main-site domain—for example, account A on `glados.network` and account B on `glados.rocks`.
5. Make sure the script is enabled in ScriptCat. A manual first run is recommended.

The first two script-menu commands are **Check in now** and **View signed-in accounts**. The first runs a complete check-in and uses the existing notification settings. The second shows each signed-in domain and masked email in a local browser notification only; it does not read or display cookie contents or send this status to remote notification channels.

The script schedules candidate runs every five minutes from `00:05` through `23:55`. Each run scans all seven domains, deduplicates sessions by email, and checks in every discovered account. ScriptCat's `once` mechanism skips later candidates only after all discovered accounts complete; partial network failures remain eligible for a later retry.

ScriptCat does not store account cookies. Once you sign out of a domain or its session expires, that domain's account is no longer discovered or checked in.

> [!TIP]
> If your session expires, click the notification to open the GLaDOS sign-in page. ScriptCat's run status contains logs for troubleshooting failed runs.

### Surge

1. Open Modules in Surge, select Install Module from URL, and paste:

   ```text
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Walvez/glados-auto-checkin/refs/heads/main/Surge/glados-auto-checkin.sgmodule
   ```

2. Enable the module and make sure scripting, rewrite, and MitM are enabled. Install and trust the Surge CA certificate if this is your first time using MitM.
3. Keep Surge active, sign in to GLaDOS in your browser, and refresh the page.
4. Setup is complete when you receive the credential capture notification.

The default schedule checks in at `07:15`, with a fallback run at `15:15` only if the morning run did not succeed. Sign in again or refresh GLaDOS whenever your credentials change.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Surge module currently stores one account. Capturing another account replaces the previous credentials; this release does not change that behavior.

<details>
<summary><strong>Run an immediate manual test</strong></summary>

`surge-cli script evaluate` accepts a local file path only. Download the current script before evaluating it:

```bash
curl -fsSL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Walvez/glados-auto-checkin/refs/heads/main/glados.autosign.surge.js' -o /tmp/glados.autosign.surge.js
/Applications/Surge.app/Contents/Applications/surge-cli script evaluate /tmp/glados.autosign.surge.js cron 20
```

</details>

### Quantumult X

1. Add and enable this URL as a Rewrite resource:

   ```text
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Walvez/glados-auto-checkin/refs/heads/main/QuantumultX/glados-auto-checkin.snippet
   ```

2. Enable Rewrite and MitM, then install and trust the MitM certificate.
3. Add this scheduled task under `[task_local]`:

   ```ini
   15 7,15 * * * https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Walvez/glados-auto-checkin/refs/heads/main/glados.autosign.surge.js, tag=GLaDOS签到, enabled=true
   ```

4. Keep Quantumult X active, sign in to GLaDOS in your browser, and refresh the page.
5. After the credential capture notification appears, run `GLaDOS签到` once from the scheduled tasks list.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Quantumult X setup currently stores one account. Capturing another account replaces the previous credentials; this release does not change that behavior.

### GitHub Actions

Use this when you do not want a browser, Surge, or Quantumult X running locally. After setup, GitHub performs the scheduled check-in in the cloud. This first version is configured for one account and uses one Repository Secret named `GLADOS_COOKIE`.

> [!NOTE]
> A fork does not inherit Secrets from its parent repository. Configure the cookie only in **your own fork**—never put it in source code, an issue, or a public log.

#### 1. Fork and enable the workflow

1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/Walvez/glados-auto-checkin/fork) into your GitHub account.
2. Open the fork and verify the repository owner shown at the top is your username.
3. Open the **Actions** tab. Scheduled workflows may be disabled on a new public fork; enable workflows if GitHub shows that prompt.

#### 2. Copy the cookie for one account

Do this once for the account you want to check in:

1. Sign in on the main-site domain you plan to use, such as [glados.cloud](https://glados.cloud) or [glados.rocks](https://glados.rocks).
2. Press `F12`, open **Network**, and refresh the GLaDOS page.
3. Select a request such as `/api/user/status` or `/console` that was sent to the current GLaDOS domain.
4. Under **Request Headers**, find `Cookie` and copy its **value only**, without the `Cookie:` prefix. It normally resembles:

   ```text
   koa:sess=...; koa:sess.sig=...
   ```

5. Record the current domain as well. Do not send the cookie to ChatGPT or put it in source code, issues, pull requests, or logs.

A cookie is a login credential and may expire after several weeks. Never publish it or send it to another person.

#### 3. Create the `GLADOS_COOKIE` Secret

1. In **your fork**, open **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.
2. Under **Repository secrets**, click **New repository secret**.
3. Enter the case-sensitive name `GLADOS_COOKIE`.
4. Paste the complete cookie value directly into **Secret**, without the `Cookie:` prefix and without JSON:

```text
koa:sess=<your-cookie-value>; koa:sess.sig=<your-signature>
```

5. Click **Add secret**. This first version uses this one Secret for one account.

If no domain is specified in the Secret, the CLI probes supported domains automatically; the cookie is still sent only to the GLaDOS official domain where it is recognized. Empty input fails fast, and logs never print the complete cookie.

#### 4. Run once and verify

1. Open **Actions** and select **GLaDOS Check-in** on the left.
2. Click **Enable workflow** first if it appears.
3. Click **Run workflow**, keep the branch set to `main`, then click the green **Run workflow** button.
4. Open the new run and wait for `Run GLaDOS check-in` to finish.
5. A green check means the check-in succeeded or was already completed today. Logs never print the complete cookie.

If the account fails, the job is red so an expired credential is visible.

#### 5. Automatic schedule

The check-in workflow runs once per day. GitHub `schedule` uses **UTC**:

| Cron (UTC) | Beijing time (UTC+8) | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `30 1 * * *` | **09:30** | Fixed check-in |

If the account was already checked in today, the API returns “already checked in” and the process still exits `0`. GitHub may queue scheduled jobs, so the job is not guaranteed to start at the exact minute.

> [!WARNING]
> GitHub documents that scheduled workflows are disabled by default on public forks and may also be disabled after 60 days without repository activity. Re-enable the workflow and run it manually if the schedule stops. Scheduled jobs may also be queued and are not guaranteed to start at the exact minute. See [GitHub's workflow documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/manage-workflow-runs/disable-and-enable-workflows).

#### 6. Keepalive workflow

`Repository Keepalive` checks `.github/keepalive/last-run.txt` daily and commits a new UTC timestamp only when the previous marker is at least 30 days old. It updates only this dedicated file and never reads `GLADOS_COOKIE`. On its first run, it creates the marker; if the repository prevents workflows from writing contents, allow workflow content updates in the repository's Actions settings.

#### 7. Update an expired cookie

Sign in again on the corresponding domain, copy the new cookie, then edit the existing `GLADOS_COOKIE` under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**. Save it without changing the workflow. Do not send the cookie to ChatGPT.

#### 8. Local / CLI (optional)

Requires Node.js 18+ (Actions pins current LTS major **24**):

```bash
export GLADOS_COOKIE='koa:sess=...; koa:sess.sig=...'
npm run checkin
# or: node cli/checkin.js
```

Optional: `GLADOS_ORIGIN=https://glados.cloud` supplies a default domain for entries without `origin`; a per-account `origin` takes priority.

#### 8. Notifications

Actions **does not** embed third-party push services (no extra secrets or data egress). Rely on:

- Job success/failure status (any account failure → exit code `1`, red job)
- Your GitHub notification settings for Actions

If you add push yourself, keep it optional, minimize payload fields, and add tests.

## Notification Examples

The scripts distinguish a new successful check-in from one already completed earlier that day and use a compact one-line format that fits system notifications.

| New check-in | Already checked in |
| :--- | :--- |
| `.network: 14**5@qq.com, ✅, +7; 316积分, 411天.` | `.rocks: qq**5@gmail.com, 已签, +10; 271积分, 426天.` |

`✅` means this run completed the first check-in of the day; `已签` means the account had already checked in. Multi-account notifications use one line per domain and omit the verbose summary sentence.

The points shown in notifications are always the **live spendable balance re-read after the check-in** (`/api/user/points`), not the historical snapshot inside the check-in records — so if you exchanged points earlier that day, the notification reflects the balance after the exchange. When the live points endpoint is unavailable, the notification falls back to the balance in the check-in record.

ScriptCat uses browser notifications by default and optionally supports PushDeer, ServerChan, Telegram, WeCom, DingTalk, Feishu, PushMe, and Bark. Surge and Quantumult X use their built-in notifications only.

<details>
<summary><strong>Configure ScriptCat remote notifications</strong></summary>

Open the script menu in ScriptCat and enter credentials for any channels you want to use. Multiple channels can be active at the same time; save an empty value to disable one.

- WeCom, DingTalk, and Feishu accept either a key/token or a complete webhook URL
- Set the DingTalk custom keyword to `GLaDOS` if keyword validation is enabled
- Notification credentials are stored only in ScriptCat's local storage
- Use the Test Remote Notifications menu command to verify your setup

</details>

## How It Works

```text
Detect session → Request check-in → Validate response → Read points and expiry → Notify locally
      ↓                 ↓
 Multi-domain      Limited retries
```

- ScriptCat scans all 7 main-site domains (`glados.network` → `glados.rocks` → `glados.one` → `glados.space` → `glados.cloud` → `glados.vip` → `glados-facility.com`), collects active sessions, deduplicates them by email, and checks each account in on its original domain before sending one summary notification.
- Surge and Quantumult X capture credentials and the active origin from any of those main sites via MitM, and always send check-in requests to that same domain. Both remain single-account methods: newly captured credentials replace the previous account. They run at `07:15` and `15:15` by default.
- GitHub Actions / CLI use one cookie Secret in this first version. Without an explicit domain, the CLI probes all 7 domains with `glados.cloud` first, and the body token always matches the actual request hostname.
- Unknown responses, HTML error pages, 401/403, 429, and 5xx responses are handled separately. Success is reported only when the script recognizes a check-in record or an explicit success state.

## Custom Schedule

The default Cron expression for Surge / Quantumult X is `15 7,15 * * *`, meaning 07:15 and 15:15 every day. GitHub Actions uses `.github/workflows/checkin.yml` and runs at 09:30 Beijing time (01:30 UTC).

To run Surge / Quantumult X only once at 07:15, use:

```cron
15 7 * * *
```

- **Surge**: download the module, change `cronexp`, and install it as a local module.
- **Quantumult X**: edit the Cron expression under `[task_local]`.

## Security and Privacy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not publish proxy configuration files, logs, Actions log screenshots, or Secret values. They may contain authentication credentials.

- ScriptCat uses your existing browser session and does not explicitly read, store, or upload your GLaDOS cookies.
- Surge and Quantumult X store the cookie, authorization value, and active domain only in the proxy app's local persistent storage, and send them only to the corresponding official GLaDOS main-site domain (one of the 7 listed above).
- Surge and Quantumult X do not call third-party notification services.
- When explicitly enabled, ScriptCat remote notifications contain only a masked email, check-in result, points, and remaining days. They never include GLaDOS cookies or authorization values.
- **GitHub Actions**: the cookie lives only in Repository Secret `GLADOS_COOKIE`; the check-in workflow uses minimal `contents: read`, while the keepalive workflow uses `contents: write` only to update its dedicated timestamp; the CLI redacts cookies/Bearer tokens and workflows never echo the Secret. After forking, set Secrets on **your** repository—never put cookies in code or pull requests.
- The project includes no analytics, advertisements, referral links, or third-party executable code.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Why does it keep asking me to sign in?</strong></summary>

Make sure your proxy app is handling the browser traffic, MitM and Rewrite are enabled, and the CA certificate is trusted. Then sign in to GLaDOS again and refresh the page.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why are there two runs per day?</strong></summary>

The second run is a fallback. It exits silently if the morning check-in succeeded or was already completed, and retries only when the morning run failed. See [Custom Schedule](#custom-schedule) to change it to one run per day.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need to configure every domain?</strong></summary>

No. The scripts support all 7 GLaDOS main-site domains (`glados.network`, `glados.rocks`, `glados.one`, `glados.space`, `glados.cloud`, `glados.vip`, `glados-facility.com`), detect your active session, and use the same domain for check-in. Cookies are usually not shared across those domains, but each is detected independently. The defunct `glados.live` and the promo redirect `glados.top` are not included.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Are my credentials uploaded?</strong></summary>

Local options: credentials stay in the browser or proxy app and are sent only to the matching official GLaDOS domain.

GitHub Actions: credentials stay in your repository Secret and are sent only to official GLaDOS domains at runtime—they are not committed to git. See [Security and Privacy](#security-and-privacy).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>GitHub Actions keeps failing / asks me to sign in</strong></summary>

The cookie may have expired (often after several weeks) or been copied incompletely. Sign in again at [glados.cloud](https://glados.cloud) (or another main site), update Secret `GLADOS_COOKIE`, and **Run workflow** manually. Cookies usually do not work across domains; the CLI probes all 7.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I see “please checkin via ...”</strong></summary>

This usually means the check-in body token does not match the current request hostname. The official GLaDOS client sends a domain-specific token—for example, `glados.network` on `glados.network` and `glados.rocks` on `glados.rocks`. Every script in this repository now derives the token from the actual origin.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The Actions schedule never runs</strong></summary>

GitHub may not fire `schedule` on new or inactive forks. Use **Run workflow** to validate, or trigger `workflow_dispatch` from an external cron. Workflow comments and the table above document UTC vs Beijing time.

</details>

## Development and Testing

Node.js 18+ is required. After cloning the repository, run:

```bash
npm test
```

Tests cover ScriptCat cross-domain multi-account discovery, same-account deduplication and partial-failure isolation, all 7 main-site domains, single-account Surge and Quantumult X runtimes, GitHub Actions / CLI (single account, missing secrets, domain fallback, cookie redaction, success / already-checked / failure exit codes), invalid JSON, 401/403 handling, 429 retries, 5xx handling, config hostname/regex coverage, stable update URLs, the keepalive workflow, and notification boundaries.
